# MATLAB Continuation Load Flow for Transmission & Distribution Systems

This repository contains a MATLAB-based implementation of the **Continuation Load Flow (CLF)** method applied to both **transmission** and **distribution** power systems.  
The project focuses on **voltage stability analysis**, **reactive power assessment**, and the **impact of renewable energy integration**.

## 📌 Objectives
- Implement Continuation Load Flow (predictor–corrector approach) in MATLAB  
- Analyze voltage stability and loadability limits  
- Compare CLF results with conventional load flow methods  
- Study the effect of **PV and wind generation** on system voltage profile  
- Apply the method to both **transmission** and **radial distribution** networks
